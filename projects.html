                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                related to the project itself.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>The second project is a cryptocurrency trading algorithm.
                The algorithm is designed to track cryptocurrency prices and
                make trades based on the price of different conversion rates
                between different cryptocurrencies. It uses the Bellman-Ford
                to identify potential trading cycles that could be profitable.
